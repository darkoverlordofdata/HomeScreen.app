I guess you can fake an SSB in firefox by some hacking. I don't know how much work you want to put into this but here a sketch of an idea.

- Create a new Profile in firefox: open about:profiles click in create new profile and give it the name of the SSB application you want to create.

- Open firefox in the new profile by running the command firefox --no-remote -P "ProfileName"

- Check if you are in the correct profile by opening about:support, in the information table look for Profile Directory. The path must end in "ProfileName". Click in Open Directory.

- Let's hide your GUI: create a new folder in your Profile Directory named chrome, inside the folder create a new file named userChrome.css.

- Paste the following inside the file:

TabsToolbar {
  visibility: collapse;
}

:root:not([customizing]) #navigator-toolbox:not(:hover):not(:focus-within) {
  max-height: 1px;
  min-height: calc(0px);
  overflow: hidden;
}

#navigator-toolbox::after {
  display: none !important;
}

#main-window[sizemode="maximized"] #content-deck {
  padding-top: 8px;
}

- Back to firefox, make sure you are in the correct profile, go to about:config and set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true

- Finally create a shortcut that runs the command firefox --name=AppName --no-remote -P "ProfileName" http://appurl.com

===============================

firefox --name=Office --no-remote -P "Office" https://office.com

- Add the shortcut to the menu. In linux probably means writing a .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications
